## üõ°Ô∏è Software Security Practices

This repository is maintained as part of Heliobright's commitment to  
secure-by-default infrastructure design. We follow best practices for  
infrastructure-as-code (IaC) security and apply automated scanning tools to  
ensure code and configuration safety.

### ‚úÖ Continuous Security Tools

We utilize the following tools as part of our continuous validation pipeline:

- [**Super-Linter**](https://github.com/github/super-linter): Scans for  
  errors and bad practices across:
  - `terraform`, `markdown`, `yaml`, `github_actions`, and more.
- **Checkov**: Validates Terraform security misconfigurations and compliance
  against AWS best practices.
- **TFLint** and **Terraform FMT**: Enforce consistent, error-free  
  Terraform formatting and linting.
- **Terrascan**: Scans for violations against known security policies in IaC  
  templates.
- **Secret scanning and code scanning**: Enabled via GitHub security settings.

Security scanning is executed automatically via GitHub Actions for every PR  
to `main` and on a scheduled weekly basis.

## ü§ù Coordinated Disclosure Policy

We adhere to coordinated disclosure practices. If the vulnerability impacts  
downstream consumers, we will collaborate on a responsible communication and  
remediation timeline prior to public disclosure.
